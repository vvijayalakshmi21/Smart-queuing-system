**Project tasks (at a high level):**
1) Propose a possible hardware solution
2) Build out the application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
3) Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best
4) Revise the proposal based on the test results


**Scenarios:**<br/>
Three different scenarios that depict real-world problems based on different sectors where edge devices are typically deployed.<br/>
Scenario 1: Manufacturing Sector<br/>
Scenario 2: Retail Sector<br/>
Scenario 3: Transportation Sector
